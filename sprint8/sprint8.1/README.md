## Setting Up the `.env` File

Before running the project, you will need to create a `.env` file in the root of the project to provide your MySQL credentials.<br>
Follow these steps:

1. Open any text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code, TextEdit).
2. Add the necessary environment variables (e.g., MySQL credentials) in the following format:
```plaintext
MYSQL_USER=yourMySQLusername
MYSQL_PASSWORD=yourMySQLpassword
HOST=127.0.0.1
```
3. Save the file as `.env`.
